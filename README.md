# Woo-Surfr-Compare

The name is the game. Pretty much everyone knows that woosting gives you more height than using the Surfr App. "SpaceX Kitesurfing" posted a video recently, comparing the two. This video is also the basis of the calculations here - it has to be noted that according to the video Woo also creates outlier jumps that can make the difference even higher.

This Single page application features german and english language support, dark and light mode and animated bars.

It was created with the help of the [T3-Stack] (https://create.t3.gg/) (mainly [tailwind] (https://tailwindcss.com/), since this app is small), [shadcn/ui] (https://ui.shadcn.com/), [radix/ui] (https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [react-spring] (https://www.react-spring.dev/).
